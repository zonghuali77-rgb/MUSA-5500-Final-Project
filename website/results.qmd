# Comparative Stats

This section presents a cross-city comparison of bus stop density and 
walk-based accessibility indicators. While the underlying methods are 
consistent across all cities, interpretation must consider each city’s 
unique transit system design, land-use context, and service philosophy.

## 1. Bus stop density

![](../figures/density_bar_chart.png)

### **Interpretation**

The four cities show substantial variation in bus stop density:

- **Singapore (6.58 stops/km²)**  
  Exhibits the highest density, consistent with a fully planned bus system
  designed to provide short and regular walking access island-wide.

- **Amsterdam (4.7 stops/km²)**  
  Dense stop pattern supported by its compact form and the interplay of buses,
  trams and metro within the historical core.

- **Shanghai (2.87 stops/km²)**  
  The number understates the density of the built-up urban core because the
  municipal boundary includes very large peripheral, industrial and rural areas.

- **New York City (2.48 stops/km²)**  
  The lowest of the four cities, reflecting the bus network's role as a
  secondary mode alongside an extensive subway system.

### **Key takeaway**

Density reflects **urban form** and **planning philosophy**, not just network size:

- Strong central planning → very high density (Singapore)  
- Compact historic city → medium–high density (Amsterdam)  
- Huge administrative territory → diluted density (Shanghai)  
- Subway-dominant transit → lower bus density (NYC)

## 2. Density summary table

The table highlights the interaction between land area and stop counts.
Most notably, Shanghai's density is **moderate**, but only because its
administrative area is exceptionally large.

# 3. Detailed accessibility indicators

This table reports Euclidean and network-based 500 m coverage, covered area,
and nearest-neighbour distance statistics.

---

## **A. 500 m Euclidean coverage (≈47–57%)**

Contrary to earlier expectations, the Euclidean 500 m coverage values are **not**
uniform across cities:

| City | Euclidean Coverage | Interpretation |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Amsterdam (56.8%)** | Highest—compact area and dense core coverage. |
| **NYC (56.1%)** | Surprisingly high despite low density; reflects concentrated built-up areas and long bus corridors. |
| **Singapore (55.9%)** | Consistently accessible network resulting from systematic stop spacing. |
| **Shanghai (47.5%)** | *Lower than the others*, because the municipal boundary includes vast low-density tracts where no coverage is intended. |

### **Why Shanghai's value is lower now**

- The boundary used in the analysis is **much larger than the functional city**.  
- Even with dense stop spacing in Puxi/Pudong, the outer districts dilute the ratio.  
- This does **not** indicate worse accessibility within the inhabited urban core.

---

## **B. Network-based 500 m walking coverage (≈16–43%)**

The network-based coverage metric—unlike Euclidean buffers—follows actual
walkable streets. It therefore produces **much smaller values**, which is expected.

| City | Network Coverage | Interpretation |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| **NYC (43.3%)** | Highest, due to extensive walkable street grids and long interconnected bus corridors. |
| **Singapore (34.0%)** | Regular street layout produces balanced accessibility but limited by natural barriers and expressways. |
| **Amsterdam (29.6%)** | Compact organic street pattern creates excellent local accessibility but reduces reachable land area at 500 m when measured over the full municipal extent. |
| **Shanghai (15.8%)** | Lowest, again driven by the **scale of the boundary**—outer districts contain large areas with sparse streets or non-residential land. |

### **Why network coverage < Euclidean coverage**

A 500-m circle overestimates walkable distance;  
a 500-m *network* buffer reflects:

- barriers (rivers, rail lines, highways),  
- cul-de-sac layouts,  
- differences in street connectivity.

Thus, **network coverage is more realistic**.

## **C. Nearest-neighbour distances**

| City | Mean NN Dist | Interpretation |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Amsterdam (63 m)** | Dense mesh of stops and tram corridors. |
| **Singapore (79 m)** | Regular spacing aligned with planning guidelines. |
| **Shanghai (91 m)** | Tight spacing in urban core, wider gaps in peri-urban districts. |
| **NYC (183 m)** | Widest spacing due to long blocks and subway-oriented network function. |

The distribution shape (min–max and 90th percentile) confirms:

- **NYC** has the greatest spatial inequality in stop spacing.  
- **Amsterdam/Singapore** have consistent, predictable spacing.  
- **Shanghai** mixes highly dense urban cores with much sparser outer districts.

# 4. Cross-city insights

### **1. Density does not directly predict coverage**
Although Singapore has more than double Amsterdam’s density, their  
Euclidean coverage is nearly identical (≈56%).  
The *distribution* of stops matters more than the count.

### **2. Network-based coverage reveals true accessibility**
Coverage drops sharply (e.g., Amsterdam 56.8% → 29.6%) when walking barriers
are considered, showing that Euclidean buffers systematically overestimate
accessibility.

### **3. Administrative boundaries heavily influence results**
Shanghai's lower coverage (Euclidean and network) is due to the inclusion of
vast non-urban areas.  
Within the actual built-up city, coverage is much higher.

### **4. Nearest-neighbour spacing is the best indicator of street-level accessibility**
It captures walkability and network structure far more effectively than density.
